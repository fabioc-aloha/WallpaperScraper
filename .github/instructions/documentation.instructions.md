# Documentation Procedural Memory

## Documentation Structure and Organization
- Create comprehensive README.md with project overview
- Include installation, usage, and contribution guidelines
- Use clear headings and consistent formatting
- Provide examples and code snippets for key features
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md for version history

## Docstring Standards (PEP 257)
- Use triple quotes for all docstrings
- Include one-line summary for simple functions
- Provide detailed descriptions for complex functionality
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Use consistent style (Google, NumPy, or Sphinx format)

## API Documentation
- Generate documentation from docstrings automatically
- Include type hints for all public interfaces
- Provide usage examples in docstrings
- Document configuration options and environment variables
- Create architectural decision records (ADRs) for major choices

## Code Comments and Inline Documentation
- Use comments sparingly, only for complex logic
- Explain why, not what the code does
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use TODO comments for planned improvements
- Document algorithmic complexity where relevant

## Technical Writing Best Practices
- Write for your target audience (users vs developers)
- Use active voice and clear, concise language
- Include visual aids (diagrams, screenshots) when helpful
- Test all code examples to ensure they work
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout documentation
