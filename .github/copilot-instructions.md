# GitHub Copilot Instructions for This Repository

## Architectural and Strategic Guidelines

- You must consult `DECISIONS.md` before proposing or making any architectural or strategic changes.
- Do not suggest changes that contradict `DECISIONS.md` unless explicitly instructed by a human contributor.
- `DECISIONS.md` is the authoritative record of architectural decisions and must be treated as such.
- Do not make changes to `PAPER.md` without explicit user consent.

## Knowledge Sharing and Documentation

- All significant implementation learnings, optimizations, and failures must be documented in `LEARNINGS.md`.
- Use `LEARNINGS.md` as a reference to inform suggestions, avoid previously encountered issues, and build upon existing solutions.

## Azure Development Standards

- This project adheres to Microsoft Azure best practices.
- When generating Azure-related code, terminal commands, or operational procedures, consult the `azure_development-get_best_practices` tool if available.

## Continuous Learning and Documentation

- When you have a major breakthrough, implementation idea, or key lesson (especially when developing or refining tools such as document converters), you must automatically record it in `LEARNINGS.md`.
- Ensure that all significant insights, optimizations, and failures are captured in `LEARNINGS.md` to support continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.
