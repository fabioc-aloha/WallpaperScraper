# Self-Learning Vibe Coding - Python Cognitive Memory Architecture

IMPORTANT: This file serves as Global Python Declarative Memory. Keep minimal and efficient. Detailed execution resides in specialized memory files.

## ðŸ§  Python Cognitive Architecture Status

**Working Memory**: 4/4 rules (at optimal capacity for Python development)
**Consolidation**: Auto-trigger when exceeding capacity
**Memory Distribution**: Active across Python procedural (.instructions.md) and development episodic (.prompt.md) systems

## ðŸš€ Python Working Memory - Quick Reference (Limit: 4 Critical Rules)

| Priority | Rule | Load | Auto-Consolidate |
|----------|------|------|------------------|
| P1 | `@pythonic` - Follow Python PEP standards and Pythonic idioms | Low | Never |
| P2 | `@venv` - Always use .venv virtual environment for dependencies | Medium | >30 days unused |
| P3 | `@meditation` - Auto-consolidate when working memory capacity exceeded | **OPTIMIZED** | When triggered |
| P4 | `@testing` - Write comprehensive tests with pytest and maintain coverage | Medium | When obsolete |

**Meditation Status**: âœ… COMPLETED (July 13, 2025) - Cognitive architecture optimized, patterns consolidated, working memory refreshed

## ðŸŽ¯ General Coding Principles
Always apply the KISS and DRY principles when writing code.
Avoid using complex or unnecessary abstractions that can make the code harder to understand.
Use descriptive variable and function names to make the code self-documenting.
Keep functions small and focused on a single task to enhance readability and maintainability.
Avoid deep nesting of code blocks; use early returns to simplify control flow.
Use comments sparingly and only when necessary to clarify complex logic.
We use powershell for automation tasks, so prefer PowerShell scripts for automation over other languages.
When writing PowerShell scripts, use the `Write-Host` cmdlet for outputting information to the console.

## ðŸŽ¯ Python Cognitive Architecture Coordination

### Multi-Modal Python Memory Distribution

**Procedural Memory Activation** (Context-Dependent):
- `python.instructions.md` â†’ Python standards and best practices for .py files, PEP compliance
- `testing.instructions.md` â†’ Testing patterns for test_*.py files, pytest configurations
- `documentation.instructions.md` â†’ Documentation standards for README, docstrings, API docs
- `packaging.instructions.md` â†’ Package management for setup.py, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml
- `data-science.instructions.md` â†’ Data science patterns for .ipynb, pandas, numpy workflows
- `learning.instructions.md` â†’ Meta-cognitive learning and self-monitoring protocols
- `meta-cognition.instructions.md` â†’ Self-awareness and cognitive monitoring patterns

**Episodic Memory Activation** (Problem-Solving):
- `code-review.prompt.md` â†’ Systematic Python code review and quality assessment workflows
- `debugging.prompt.md` â†’ Python debugging and troubleshooting procedures with pdb
- `refactoring.prompt.md` â†’ Python code refactoring and optimization methodologies
- `testing.prompt.md` â†’ Comprehensive testing workflows with pytest and coverage
- `data-analysis.prompt.md` â†’ Data analysis and visualization workflows
- `package-development.prompt.md` â†’ Python package creation and distribution
- `consolidation.prompt.md` â†’ Memory consolidation and cognitive architecture optimization
- `performance-optimization.prompt.md` â†’ Python performance analysis and optimization

- `self-assessment.prompt.md` â†’ Cognitive performance evaluation and improvement
- `meta-learning.prompt.md` â†’ Learning strategy development and evolution
- `cognitive-health.prompt.md` â†’ Architecture health monitoring and maintenance

### Auto-Consolidation Triggers

- Working memory > 4 rules â†’ Execute consolidation.prompt.md
- Rule conflicts detected â†’ Activate learning.instructions.md
- Performance degradation â†’ Review and redistribute memory load
- User requests meditation â†’ Full cognitive architecture optimization
- **Virtual environment issues â†’ Execute environment-setup.prompt.md**
- **Meta-cognitive assessment needed â†’ Execute self-assessment.prompt.md**
- **Learning strategy evolution required â†’ Execute meta-learning.prompt.md**
- **Cognitive architecture health check â†’ Execute cognitive-health.prompt.md**

## ðŸ”„ Memory Transfer Protocol

**Immediate Transfer**: Critical errors â†’ Quick Reference (P1-P4)
**Gradual Consolidation**: Repeated patterns â†’ Procedural memory (.instructions.md)
**Complex Workflows**: Multi-step processes â†’ Episodic memory (.prompt.md)
**Archive Management**: Obsolete rules â†’ Historical storage in specialized files
**Index Maintenance**: Auto-update Long-Term Memory Index during all transfers
