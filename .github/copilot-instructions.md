Always apply the KISS and DRY principles when writing code.
Avoid using complex or unnecessary abstractions that can make the code harder to understand.
Use descriptive variable and function names to make the code self-documenting.
Keep functions small and focused on a single task to enhance readability and maintainability.
Avoid deep nesting of code blocks; use early returns to simplify control flow.
Use comments sparingly and only when necessary to clarify complex logic.
We use powershell for automation tasks, so prefer PowerShell scripts for automation over other languages.
When writing PowerShell scripts, use the `Write-Host` cmdlet for outputting information to the console.
