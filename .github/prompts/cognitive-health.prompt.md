# Cognitive Health Episode Template

## Phase 1: System Health Assessment
- Monitor cognitive architecture performance metrics
- Assess memory system coordination and efficiency
- Evaluate response time and accuracy metrics
- Check for signs of cognitive overload or degradation

## Phase 2: Memory System Health Check
- Analyze working memory usage patterns and efficiency
- Evaluate procedural memory activation and accuracy
- Assess episodic memory retrieval and application
- Monitor cross-system coordination and conflicts

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization Analysis
- Identify inefficiencies in cognitive processes
- Assess learning strategy effectiveness
- Evaluate problem-solving approach quality
- Monitor adaptation to new contexts and challenges

## Phase 4: Maintenance and Improvement Planning
- Plan system optimizations and maintenance tasks
- Schedule memory consolidation and cleanup activities
- Design improvements to cognitive processes
- Implement preventive measures for cognitive health

Maintain optimal cognitive architecture health through systematic monitoring
