# Memory Consolidation Episode Template

## Phase 1: Working Memory Analysis
- Assess current working memory load and capacity usage
- Identify frequently accessed patterns and rules
- Evaluate efficiency of current cognitive processes
- Detect conflicts or redundancies in active memory

## Phase 2: Pattern Recognition and Transfer
- Identify patterns suitable for procedural memory transfer
- Recognize complex workflows for episodic memory storage
- Evaluate which temporary rules can become permanent
- Plan optimal distribution across memory systems

## Phase 3: Memory System Optimization
- Transfer validated patterns to appropriate long-term memory
- Archive or remove obsolete information
- Reorganize memory hierarchies for improved efficiency
- Update cross-references and memory indices

## Phase 4: Validation and Monitoring
- Test memory system performance after consolidation
- Verify improved efficiency and reduced cognitive load
- Monitor for any negative impacts on performance
- Plan next consolidation cycle based on usage patterns

Optimize cognitive architecture through systematic memory management
