# Purpose and Goals

## Overview
The Ultra Resolution Wallpaper Scraper efficiently acquires and standardizes high-quality wallpapers at scale, providing an automated solution for users needing ultra-resolution images for digital displays, backgrounds, or marketing materials.

## Core Goals
1. **Automated Wallpaper Acquisition**:
   - Reliable fetching from a configurable list of reputable wallpaper providers
   - Support for high-volume parallel processing
   - Handling of diverse image sources, formats, and resolutions

2. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Consistent ultra-resolution outputs (e.g., 5120×1440 or higher, configurable)
   - Preservation of image detail, color integrity, and aspect ratio
   - Advanced validation for image clarity and resolution

3. **Performance and Reliability**:
   - Efficient parallel processing with robust error handling
   - Progress tracking and resume capabilities
   - Caching to minimize redundant downloads

4. **Data Management**:
   - Comprehensive processing status tracking
   - Enriched output with download and source metadata
   - Support for incremental processing of large image datasets

## Success Criteria
- Wallpaper acquisition success rate >90% from primary wallpaper sites
- Consistent ultra-resolution output (e.g., 5120×1440 or better) with standardized quality
- Efficient resource management for parallel processing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Processing thousands of wallpapers with minimal manual intervention

# Architectural Decisions

## 1. Code Organization

### Implementation
- **Module Structure**: Services for external integrations (for wallpaper API integrations), utilities for common functions (image processing, URL management, etc.)
- **Centralized Configuration**: Single config.py for all settings including wallpaper resolution defaults, themes, and storage paths
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive code documentation and README updated for wallpaper use case
- **Modular Plugin System**: Extensible architecture to add new wallpaper sources easily
- **Site-Specific Services**: Each wallpaper site will have its own service file to handle fetching and searching wallpapers directly. For example, a service file for `4kwallpapers.com` will be created to manage its specific logic.

### Pending Improvements
- Additional plugin discovery mechanism for new wallpaper providers
- Embed unit tests directly within each service module to simplify unit testing and keep tests close to implementation
- Integration of advanced image enhancement or watermark removal techniques

## 2. Storage Structure

### Implementation
```
C:\Data\
    ├── wallpapers\   # Processed ultra-resolution wallpapers
    ├── temp\         # Temporary files during downloads and processing
```

- **Automated Management**: Temp file cleanup with user confirmation
- **Consistent Access**: Standard paths defined in configuration for storing wallpapers
- **Clear Organization**: Separate directories for raw downloads and processed wallpapers

## 3. Wallpaper Processing Pipeline

### Implementation
- **Primary Source**: Configurable list of reputable wallpaper sites
- **Fallback**: None (focus on high-quality sources only)
- **Image Requirements**: Ultra-resolution (e.g., 5120×1440 or higher, configurable) output in standardized format (PNG or JPEG)
- **Themes**: Configurable themes for wallpaper search (e.g., nature, abstract, technology)

### Features
- Intelligent selection of wallpaper quality based on source metadata
- Support for all common image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- Optimized image scaling and enhancement while preserving quality
- Advanced error handling and retry logic for downloads
- Comprehensive logging and progress tracking per wallpaper

## 4. Service Layer Design

### Implementation
- **Service Boundaries**: One service per wallpaper source integration
- **Consistent Interfaces**: Standard methods and error handling across all source services
- **Performance**: HTTP retry logic with exponential backoff for image downloads
- **Reliability**: Rate limiting and request throttling where necessary

### Features
- Service-level metrics collection for downloads
- Local response caching to avoid duplicate image downloads
- Centralized error handling and logging
- Shared HTTP client configuration for efficiency

## 5. Data Input and Filtering

### Implementation
- **Input Format**: None (directly fetch from configured wallpaper sites)
- **Filtering Options**: Configurable themes and resolution settings
- **Validation**: Data integrity checks before processing wallpapers

### Features
- Filtering for wallpaper type, resolution, and themes
- Specific source targeting with site-specific identifiers
- Detailed error reporting for invalid or missing data

## 6. Error Management

### Implementation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error and progress tracking during wallpaper downloads and processing
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff on transient failures
- **Progress Preservation**: Resume capability after interruptions to avoid re-downloading the same images
- **Transparency**: Clear error messages and status reporting for troubleshooting

### Features
- Detailed per-wallpaper processing information
- Success/failure attribution by source
- Batch progress statistics with completion percentage
- Time-based estimates (elapsed and remaining) for overall processing
- Structured error categorization and reporting for analysis

## 7. Parallel Processing

### Implementation
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch size (default remains 300, but may be tuned for high-resolution downloads)
- **Resource Management**: Controlled parallel execution to manage bandwidth and processing load
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed status reporting during execution

### Features
- Per-wallpaper progress tracking
- Overall progress percentage calculation
- Time-based progress estimates for downloads and processing operations
- Resource cleanup and optimization for large datasets

## 8. HTTP Handling

### Implementation
- **Session Management**: Consistent configuration across wallpaper source services
- **Rate Limiting**: Service-specific request throttling to comply with provider guidelines
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retries for transient network errors
- **Reliability**: Connection pooling and request optimization

### Features
- Robust retry logic with exponential backoff
- Intelligent handling of varied error types during download
- Configurable retry attempts and delays
- Detailed error logging during each HTTP request

## 9. Configuration Management

### Implementation
- **Centralized Settings**: Single config.py with logical groupings for wallpaper scraper parameters
- **Themes and Sites**: Configurable themes and a list of wallpaper sites to fetch from
- **Validation**: Startup configuration verification to ensure all required parameters are properly set
- **Defaults**: Sensible preset values for ultra-resolution downloads and processing

### Features
- Configuration parameter validation at startup to ensure image quality expectations
- Progressive configuration override system for runtime adjustments

## 10. Command-Line Interface

### Implementation
- **Not Implemented**: Command-line interface options will not be included for now. Configuration will be managed through the centralized configuration file.

## Opinion on Image Sources

### Recommendation
The best approach to acquire high-quality wallpapers is to directly fetch them from reputable wallpaper sites. This ensures:
- Consistent quality and resolution
- Avoidance of potential copyright issues
- Faster and more reliable downloads

Using search engines like Bing or Google is not recommended as it may introduce challenges such as:
- Inconsistent image quality
- Difficulty in filtering for ultra-resolution images
- Potential copyright or licensing issues

## 11. Environment

- OS: Windows
- Shell: PowerShell (using PowerShell for command line operations)
